## Code Style and Standards

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code:

- Use standard **Java naming conventions** (camelCase, PascalCase for classes, etc.)
- Keep your code **clean, readable, and well-commented**
- Use **JavaDoc** for public classes and methods
- Structure your code consistently with the existing architecture
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies

We recommend using a linter or IDE plugins to enforce Java code style automatically (e.g., Checkstyle, SpotBugs).
