# Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are a fundamental tool in mathematics, allowing us to extend the real number system to include numbers with both real and imaginary parts. They have numerous applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, signal processing, and computer graphics. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of complex numbers, their properties, and how they are used in geometry.

## Definition

A complex number is a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit, which satisfies $i^2 = -1$. The real part of the complex number is $a$, and the imaginary part is $b$.

## Properties

Complex numbers have many useful properties, including:

- **Addition**: Complex numbers can be added by adding the real and imaginary parts separately: $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$.
- **Multiplication**: Complex numbers can be multiplied by multiplying the real and imaginary parts separately, and then combining the results: $(a + bi) \times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.
- **Conjugation**: The complex conjugate of a complex number $a + bi$ is $a - bi$, which is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part.

## Geometry

Complex numbers have a natural connection to geometry, as they can be used to represent points and vectors in the complex plane. In particular, complex numbers can be used to:

- **Represent points**: A point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number $a + bi$, where $a$ is the x-coordinate and $b$ is the y-coordinate.
- **Perform rotations**: Multiplying a complex number by a complex number of modulus 1 (i.e. a unit complex number) rotates the point in the complex plane by the angle of the unit complex number.
- **Perform translations**: Adding a complex number to another complex number translates the point in the complex plane by the amount of the added complex number.

Two other properties of complex numbers are useful in geometry:
- **Modulus**: The modulus of a complex number $a + bi$ is its distance from the origin in the complex plane, and is given by $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
- **Argument**: The argument of a complex number $a + bi$ is the angle between the real and imaginary parts, and is given by $\arg(a + bi) = \tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$.
