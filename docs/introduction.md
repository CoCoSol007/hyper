## Introduction to Euclidean Geometry & Beyond

For centuries, [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) was seen as the absolute framework to describe space. It’s built on a handful of simple, seemingly self-evident axioms—basic truths about points, lines, and planes. Among these, one stands out: the Fifth Axiom, or the [Parallel Postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate), which essentially states that through any point not on a given line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line.

But here’s where things get interesting. Mathematicians eventually realized that this axiom isn’t the only way to build a coherent, consistent geometry. If you tweak or reject the Fifth Axiom, you open the door to entirely new types of geometries — [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry) ones. These are just as logically valid, but they describe worlds where the rules of parallel lines, angles, and distances behave differently.

To understand these "strange" geometries, it helps to think about how we represent dimensions. Our computer screens, after all, are two-dimensional, but we often view convincing three-dimensional images on them. This illusion comes from projections—rules for translating 3D objects into a 2D view, like orthographic or perspective projection. Similarly, we can visualize [non-Euclidean spaces by projecting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHvAqDuWG2M) them onto familiar 2D surfaces.

One of the most famous of these non-Euclidean spaces is [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry), where the Parallel Postulate fails dramatically—infinitely many lines can pass through a point and never intersect a given line. There’s also [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry), but we won’t focus much on that here. Instead, we’ll dive into hyperbolic space and explore it through a powerful tool: [the Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model).

## The Poincaré disk model

In the [Poincaré disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model), the entire infinite hyperbolic plane is compressed into the interior of a circle. But there’s a catch—the edge of the circle represents points at infinity. Just like how, in real life, the horizon feels endlessly far away no matter how far you travel, the boundary of the Poincaré disk gives a visual sense of infinity. It’s similar to how parallel lines in a perspective drawing appear to meet at a vanishing point: it's not that the lines actually meet, but our projection forces that behavior.
