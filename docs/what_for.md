# What for?

You might be wondering: why did I create this project? In which scenario would you actually use it? A 3D engine sounds cool, but why a non-Euclidean one? Why not just stick with a regular 3D engine?

## Motivation

Most 3D engines are built on the assumption of Euclidean space: flat, predictable, and uniform. But what if we could break that mold? What if we could create worlds where parallel lines curve, distances warp unpredictably, and the very nature of geometry becomes part of the story?

This project takes you on a journey into non-Euclidean rendering — creating virtual environments that follow hyperbolic or spherical geometry, instead of the usual flat space.

## Why It Matters

- **New Ways to Think**: It challenges how we perceive and simulate space, pushing the limits of both mathematics and computer graphics.
- **Educational Value**: It transforms abstract geometric concepts into something tangible and engaging, providing a hands-on way to explore complex math in a fun and interactive format.

## Why It’s Challenging

- Standard graphics engines assume Euclidean geometry — and this project boldly decides to throw that assumption out the window.
- It demands a deep understanding of advanced mathematics and innovative algorithmic techniques.
- It's not easy to visualize, optimize, or make smooth — but the payoff? Totally worth it.

## Why It’s Worth It

This is not just another 3D graphics engine — it's a **thought experiment made interactive**. A playground for curiosity, a space where you can stretch your imagination and challenge how you think about geometry and space. It’s an opportunity to reimagine what 3D rendering could look like when we stop holding on to those comfy Euclidean rules.

Oh, and by the way: if you ever get lost in these warped spaces, don't worry — it’s not your fault.
